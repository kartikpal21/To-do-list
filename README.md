📝 What’s a To-Do List?

A To-Do List is your ultimate productivity sidekick — a simple but powerful way to organize tasks, prioritize work, and track progress. Think of it as your project’s roadmap that shows what needs to get done and what’s already finished.

Collaborate Easily: Share tasks with your team, assign owners, and track progress together.

Never Forget a Thing: Keep everything in one place, so no task slips through the cracks.
